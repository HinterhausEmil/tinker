 * temperature will reach this threshold immediately if the motor draws too
 * much current. In case of a voltage below 3.3V (external or stack) this
 * callback is triggered as well.
 * 
 * If this callback is triggered, the driver gets disabled at the same time.
 * That means, {@link dc_enable} has to be called to drive the motor again.
 * 
 * \note
 *  This callback only works in Drive/Brake mode (see {@link dc_set_drive_mode}). In 
 *  Drive/Coast mode it is unfortunately impossible to reliably read the 
 *  over current/over temperature signal from the driver chip.

 *  Since we can't get any feedback from the DC motor, this only works if the
